# Balanced-Expressions-Check
Given a string consisting of curly braces, square brackets and/or parenthesis, check if the string is balanced. In other words, for every opening brace/bracket/parens there is a closing brace/bracket/parens in the string. Example input: {[()]} --> "Balanced",  {[({[})]} --> "Not Balanced"
